             A key player for his club and national team, the Japanese star is opening the SuperLega doors to his compatriots

            <p style="text-indent: 2.5em;"> The SuperLega Credem Banca is widely recognised as the best men's domestic league in the world and features many of the leading players in international volleyball. These players have a huge impact on the outcome of the Italian League and this week we focus on Japanese star Yuki Ishikawa, who was the first player from his country to compete in the league, and who will lead Allianz Milano into a tough match against WithU Verona.

            <br><br>The generation that currently forms the core of Japan’s men’s national team is certainly one of the most talented the Asian country has ever produced. And hopes are it will help the nation back to its golden days in volleyball.

            <br><br>Much of that perception comes from the undeniable quality of the team’s ‘Big Three’, formed by opposite Yuji Nishida and outside hitters Yuki Ishikawa and Ran Takahashi. Although all of the players have important roles in the success of the national team, it’s impossible to ignore how pivotal team captain Ishikawa has been for the Japanese over the years.

            </center>

            <p style="text-indent: 2.5em;">The oldest player of the country's leading trio, Ishikawa, 26, has been the one to carry the torch and lead the transition from the prior generation to the current one. When he first joined the national team in 2014, the likes of Kunihiro Shimizu (opposite), Yu Koshikawa (outside hitter) and Takeshi Nagano (libero) were all still a part of the squad.

            <br><br>Before Nishida joined in 2018, and Takahashi did the same three years later, Ishikawa led the Japanese to victory at the 2017 Asian Championship (taking home the Most Valuable Player award) and to a second place finish at the 2014 Asian Games. He was also named on to the Dream Team of the 2015 FIVB Volleyball World Cup.

            <br><br>Together, the 'Big Three' represented Japan at home at last year’s Tokyo Olympics and at this year’s FIVB Volleyball Men’s World Championship in Poland and Slovenia. The more connected they get, the more the hopes of seeing a Japanese team fight for a medal at a major event grows among their fans.

            <p style="text-indent: 2.5em;">Despite the fact that he was the second son of a couple formed by a track and field athlete and a basketball player, and that he only got into volleyball because of his older sister, Naomi, Ishikawa grew used to being the first to do things in his career.

            <br><br>A standout player at high school level in Japan, he went to the Chuo University in Tokyo and was the first player in his country to combine academic commitments with a career overseas.

            Then aged 19, Ishikawa chose to start his professional career with Modena in 2014-2015 and became the first Japanese athlete to play in the Italian SuperLega.

            <br><br>Between 2014 and 2021, the outside hitter won gold in the Italian Cup and finished second in the Italian League with Modena. He also triumphed in the CEV Challenge Cup with his current club, Allianz Milano, and spent time with Latina, Siena and Padova.

            <br><br>It took some time, but his success opened doors for other Japanese players. Nishida was the first to follow in his footsteps, and spent the 2021-2022 season with Vibo Valentia. When they played Milano, it marked the first time two Japanese players had faced each other in the SuperLega.

            <br><br>“The SuperLega is the strongest national league,” said Ishikawa in an interview with Italian newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport. “There are many international players and the level is very high. I feel that being here allows me to improve and to play better with the Japan national team. I would like to have other Japanese players here. I always tell my teammates that they should come to Italy if they want to improve.”

            <br><br>After a season in the SuperLega, Nishida returned to Japan, but Ran Takahashi took the opposite route, joining Padova ahead of the 2022-2023 season to start his first playing experience in Italy.

            <p style="text-indent: 2.5em;">In his third season with Milano, Ishikawa is a key player for the team, who have an important home match against WithUVerona ahead of them on Sunday, October 31, at 00.00 GMT.<br>Milano are currently ranked fifth in the SuperLega with four wins in five matches (seven points)
